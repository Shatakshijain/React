virtual DOM, fibre and reconciliation
Fibre -  The goal of react fibre is to increase its sustainability for areas like animation, layout and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering- the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

other features include the ability to pause, abort or reuse workas new update come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates

Reconciliation - The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as 'VIRTUAL DOM'

PROPS- they make a component reusable
