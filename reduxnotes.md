redux and react-redux are different
redux is the core library and react-redux is its implementation as a wirind so that react and redux can
communicate with each other

talking about redux toolkit a lot of things are already done eg., never mutate your state

The store file is called the single source of truth
now the store does not make changes like that, it needs to know the reducer which syntactically is referred to as 
slice file 

// Dispatcher uses Reducer to make changes in values in Store.
